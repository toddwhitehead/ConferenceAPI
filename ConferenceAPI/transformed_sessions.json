If you're not having fun the learning is a chore, if you are then it hardly feels like learning at all, at least not like the thing they made you do in school. Craftsmanship is about making that commitment and then figuring out how to see it through.  Using examples of mastery from various fields and a thirty year paper-folding habit, Dan describes some of the many facets of craftsmanship and tries to figure out exactly what the craft is that we programmers do."

In this talk, we'll give an overview of the challenges of strongly-typed IRP against web data markets, web ontologies, databases, services and enterprise data schema.

    "description": "\r\n\t\t\tCQRS with Erlang\r\n\t\t\r\nErlang is an industry-proven functional programming language with unmatched sweet-spots in fault-tolerance, concurrency, and distribution. RabbitMQ, CouchDB. Facebook Chat, Opcode Chef, and WhatsApp are written in Erlang, and more than half of the world's mobile phone traffic is driven by Erlang. Erlang is also opensource, and cross-platform.\nCQRS is an architectural pattern that separates commands (which mutate state) from queries (which return values). With CQRS the &ldquo;read&rdquo; data store and the &ldquo;write&rdquo; data store can be on different severs, can use different storage engines, and can be scaled independently. CQRS is often linked with the Event Sourcing pattern which models state as a series of events (past tense verbs) rather than a single &ldquo;latest&rdquo; value. What works for an accountant&rsquo;s ledger (and for Git) can work for our &ldquo;write&rdquo; store too. Given a series of events, we can deal with concurrency and collisions more intelligently than &ldquo;last guy wins&rdquo;. We can also define varied service level agreements for our commands and our queries.\nCQRS promotes distribution, concurrency and eventual consistency which is dandy until we attempt to code an implementation with conventional tools like C# or Java. Lucky for us, Erlang is unconventional in all the right ways. Many of the ideas of CQRS dovetail perfectly with the sweet-spots of Erlang.In this session we will dive into CQRS, and explore a sample implementation written in Erlang. We will spotlight a few areas where CQRS with Erlang shines.\r\n"

Unfortunately, the common approach to the client library is to provide a procedural wrapper around the API. Often this negates any benefits of the loose coupling of the HTTP api because now the client developer is tightly coupled to the client library. Changes to the client library can become amaintenance headache.\nThis talk will demonstrate how to build client libraries that make your API just as easy to access without hiding it behind a procedural faÃ§ade. This approach will allow client devs thechance to upgrade to new versions of client libraries on their own schedule or take advantage of new features without waiting for you to release a new version of the client library. It also enables you to provide client developers with default response handling behaviors they can choose to use orreplace with their own. As an added benefit, this approach is highly compatible with the use of hypermedia so can ease the path when introducing hypermedia into your API.\r\n"

This session will get you up to speed on the essential features developers should be aware of, and how to apply them in practical scenarios. You&rsquo;ll learn how to choose between web sites and cloud services, and learn other practical tips for building Azure apps such as storing content, sending email, working with queues and choosing the right technology, and collecting important metrics for visibility into application health.\r\n"

    "description": "\r\n\t\t\tTesting of Mobile Apps with Calabash and Xamarin Test Cloud\r\n\t\t\r\nThis talk serves as an introduction to the automated UI-testing technology Calabash and to Xamarin Test Cloud, a service that provides cloud-based access to hundreds of mobile devices for automated testing purposes. You'll learn about the benefits of automated UI testing on mobile apps, and see how easy it is to get started with UI testing using Calabash. Calabash is free, open-source and supports BDD (Behaviour Driven Developent) via the Cucumber tool.\nWhile Calabash is very useful on its own, its power is only fully realized when tests are run frequently on large sets of devices with different screen-sizes, resolutions and operating system versions. In a short live demo, you'll see how you can tap into this full potential with Xamarin Test Cloud.\nAfter attending this talk you'll have an understanding of why automated UI testing is useful, an understanding of Calabash and practical knowledge on how to use it. Last but not least, you'll get an overview of what Xamarin Test Cloud offers as a mobile cloud-testing service.\nNote: While this talk uses a Xamarin app as the sample project, Xamarin Test Cloud and Calabash supports all native and hybrid mobile apps independent of technology was used to build it. Hence, familiarity with Xamarin is not needed to attend this talk.\r\n"

The next thing you learn is there a zillion different ways to do it. The core platform gives you callbacks and events, but then there are a slew of add on approaches. Now with generators in ES6 we have even more options on the table. In this talk we&rsquo;ll look at common patterns and modules for async in node and guidelines or using them. \r\n"

    "description": "\r\n\t\t\tASP.NET and OWIN - Better Together\r\n\t\t\r\nASP.NET now has first-class support for OWIN, the Open Web Interface for .NET. OWIN defines a standard interface between .NET web servers and web applications enabling OWIN based applications to run on any OWIN capable host. In this presentation you will learn the what and why of OWIN and how OWIN is now deeply integrated with the ASP.NET pipeline. You'll learn how you can easily host OWIN based components inside of ASP.NET or in your own process. I'll show you how you can take advantage of existing Microsoft OWIN components to handle security, diagnostics, servicing static content and running a variety of OWIN based frameworks. Lastly I will show you how you can create your own OWIN middleware and participate in the OWIN ecosystem\r\n"
